# mapdservices-bundle

This Nifi Service targets Nifi version 1.5 and MapD 4.1.0

The Service exposes the MapD client and session to potential processors

It current has a dependency on this maven project - https://github.com/jonrmayer/mapd_thrift_maven

But if you have built your own mapd thrift java client - this can be replaced in the pom.
